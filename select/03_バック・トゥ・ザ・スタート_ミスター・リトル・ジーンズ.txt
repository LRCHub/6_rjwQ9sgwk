Hollow and made
Time flies the same
Looking for light

Head held high 'cause dawn's in sight
Your head held high 'cause dawn's in sight

Hide all your secrets in the dark
You try to run but you fall apart
Time to admit you're out of air
Life's but a humbling affair

Can you open your heart?
Can you open your heart to me?
Going back to the start
Going back to the start you'll see

Not long after they're all gone
I wear you down to the bone
And out on seven seas
Your heart is still safe with me

Hiding your secrets in the dark
You try to run but you fall apart
Stripped of the armor that you wear
Life's but a humbling affair

Can you open your heart?
Can you open your heart to me?
Going back to the start
Going back to the start you'll see
